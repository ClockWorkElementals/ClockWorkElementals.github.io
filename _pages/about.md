# Hi! I'm Mel Hynes!

I'm a 21 year old Canadian in my final year of studying Computer Science. These pages serve as a sneak peak of some of the work I've done throughout my studies. I consider myself a strong enough programmer with a highly generalized skillset when it comes to code. I've picked up and experimented with a variety of programming languages, including:

- C#
- Java
- Kotlin
- JavaScript
- Python

I'm also currently in the process of learning Rust and C++. I pride myself in being a jack-of-all-trades programmer, and I hope to one day feel confident enough in my abilities that I can comfortably be slotted into any project and be of some use.

## Personal Information

I'm very outspoken about my passions and my identity. I soak up knowledge from science (Space, Biology, and Technology) to humanities (History, Sociology) to anything in between (Psychology, Art in all it's forms, Political Science). My special interest is in psychology, but I generally meld to any kind of conversation and I'm always in some kind of flux. I've spent my whole life consuming a range of media from video games (Pokemon, Minecraft, Hollow Knight, Detroit Become Human, Terraria, Elden Ring) to books (Ranger's Apprentice, Lord of the Rings, Throne of Glass, Shadow and Bone/Six of Crows, Rick Riordan) to shows (The entire Arrowverse, Criminal Minds, RWBY. Doctor Who). I find comfort in novelty, and I crave new experiences and new perspectives. 

## Soft Skills / Misc. Information

I've spent a severe portion of my life helping people whenever I can. I received an award with Cadets for recognition of my volunteering, I'm currently a tutor and I help moderate and administrate a 2000 person Discord server. In my later years at school, I was a Peer Supporter (a volunteer position that allows students to help their peers with mental issues that pop up, to help take the stress off the school's counselling services) and volunteered twice to be a student representative for my cohort. Helping people is part of my nature, and I'm going to make it my goal to help others with my ever-growing programming skills.
