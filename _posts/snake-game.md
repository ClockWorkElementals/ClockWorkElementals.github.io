title:  JavaScript Snake
excerpt: A small side project during a lull in school work, focusing on a language I dislike to challenge my skills.

During the winter of 2023, before classes picked up in work, I decided to keep my coding skills sharp and challenge my comfort zone at the same time. I decided the best small project that I could work on would be a mini Snake game, written in JavaScript. 

While my pasison nowadays is helping others with my code, originally I approached the field with the goal of creating games. I grew up playing video games and found myself entranced with the worlds I was lost in, and all the behind-the-scenes tools that programmers use to build them. I didn't have any game programming experience when I started the program, but I've found myself downloading mods and manipulating some game files that weren't as locked down as they should have been to my will. With every curtain I tore down to see a game's inner workings, my facination with the field grew. It's only very recently in comparison that my reasoning for programming shifted, but that bedrock still holds as well.

In contrast, I *despise* JavaScript. I find it needlessly frustrating and broken, and my style of coding largely depends on having a robust enough error system to point me in a direction when my code inevitably breaks. JS provides no semblance of structure, or even *rules* as far as I can tell. The language feels like a mockery or parody of all my skills. But, I can hate JavaScript as much as I want, the language will remain a powerhouse and having skills with the language is invaluable. With that in mind, I chose JAvaScript as my language to sharpen my skills with a simple project: I was going to code Snake.

Using TheCodingTrain's Snake Game as a base, I followed the tutorial to give myself a working version of Snake, then spent the next week trying new things out. My game follows original Snake rules, save 2 personal changes: the food (represented as circles) move after a certain amount of time instead of remaining static, and the game gets incrimentally faster as the snake grows.

The game itself is in need of an overhaul (something I plan to do now that I've had a Game Programming course) but I'm proud of this project because it was my first major project outside of LeetCode style questions or school work. I'm also proud of myself for deliberately challenging myself to build skills I want to posess even if using them is painful for me.
